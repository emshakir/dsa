# GRAPHS

- Graphs are **Hierarchical** Data structures.
- They consist of network of nodes, which are called as **VERTEX(VERTICES)**.
- Line connection two Vertices is called as **Edge**.

## EDGES

    - Directed          A -> B
    - Un-Directed       A - B (A <-> B)

## TYPES

**Weigthed:** If a values is assigned to edges, it is Weighted Graph.
**Un-Weighted:** If there is no value for edges it is unweighted.

## Storing a Graph

    - Adjacency List
    - Adjacency Matrix
    - Edge List
    - 2D \- Matrix(Implicit Graph)


## Problems

1. Creating Graph with Adjacent list
2. Breadth First Search(BFS)
3. Depth First Search(DFS)
4. Has Path
