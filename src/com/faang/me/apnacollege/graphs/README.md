# GRAPHS

- Graphs are **Hierarchical** Data structures.
- They consist of network of nodes, which are called as **VERTEX(VERTICES)**.
- Line connecting two Vertices is called as **Edge**.

## EDGES

- Directed &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A -> B
- Un-Directed &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       A - B (A <-> B)

## TYPES

**Weigthed:** If a values is assigned to edges, it is Weighted Graph.\
<br />
**Un-Weighted:** If there is no value for edges it is unweighted.

## Storing a Graph

- Adjacency List
- Adjacency Matrix
- Edge List
- 2D \- Matrix(Implicit Graph)
