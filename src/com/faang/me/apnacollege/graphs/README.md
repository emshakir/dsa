# GRAPHS
- Graphs are **Hierarchical** Data structures.
- They consist of network of nodes, which are called as **VERTEX(VERTICES)**.
- Line connection two Vertices is called as **Edge**.

## EDGES
- Directed          A -> B
- Un-Directed       A - B (A <-> B)

## TYPES
- **Weigthed:** If a values is assigned to edges, it is Weighted Graph.
- **Un-Weighted:** If there is no value for edges it is unweighted.

## Storing a Graph
- Adjacency List
- Adjacency Matrix
- Edge List
- 2D \- Matrix(Implicit Graph)
