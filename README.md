# Data structures and Algorithms

## Data Structures and Algorithms(CODING NINJAS, APNA COLLEGE, GRIND 75 and LEETCODE)

- This repo has question solved from Coding ninjas, Apna college, grind 75 and leetcode.

- Few question have explaination, how exactly the logic behind the question is working including Time and space complexity detaiils.

- Each Directory is for specific topic.

- You may find brute force approach, better and optimal approach for few questions.
